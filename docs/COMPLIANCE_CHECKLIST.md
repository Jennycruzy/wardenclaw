# Compliance Checklist

Honest status of every build requirement, with file references. ✅ done · 🟡 partial ·
❌ not yet. Nothing here is fabricated; partial/▢ items are called out plainly.

## Non-negotiables

| Requirement | Status | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Paper / simulation only, no real-capital path | ✅ | every fill labeled `paper`; `wardenExecutor.ts`, `demoExecutor.ts` (demo trading only) |
| Deterministic verdicts (LLM parses/classifies only) | ✅ | `playbookShield.ts`, `tradePermit.ts` — no LLM in the verdict path |
| Fail-closed | ✅ | stale/unknown-asset/tamper/expiry/replay → refuse; `tradePermit.ts`, `wardenPermit.ts` |
| No narrated numbers | ✅ | `ghostSim.ts`, `run-scorecard.ts` compute from real candles |
| Bitget-native tools and data | ✅ | Agent Hub, MCP client, public market data; fixtures cached |
| 6 trade verdicts / 3 strategy verdicts / 5 assets | ✅ | `TradeVerdict`, `StrategyVerdict`, `TRADEABLE_XSTOCKS` |
| Upgrade in place (repo stack) | ✅ | pnpm monorepo, reused audit/replay/compiler |

## Phases

| Phase | Requirement | Status | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Architecture audit + gap table | ✅ | `docs/ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md` |
| 0 | Asset reconciliation (5 verified, ≥2 BTC-correlated, live-checked) | ✅ | `universe.ts`, audit §5 |
| 0 | Bitget MCP registration documented | ✅ | `README.md` |
| 1 | Three strategy verdicts | ✅ | `playbookShield.ts` |
| 1 | Five static checks (+ conditional 6th) | ✅ | `playbookShield.ts`, `test/playbookShield.test.ts` |
| 1 | Strategy Safety Card (signed, chained) | ✅ | `wardenCard.ts`, `playbookShield.ts` |
| 1 | Wiring: Reject blocks, Restrict tightens compiler caps | ✅ | `bitget-adapter/src/playbook.ts`, `test/playbook.test.ts` |
| 2 | Six trade verdicts | ✅ | `tradePermit.ts` |
| 2 | Ten deterministic gates incl. premium/discount + BTC corr | ✅ | `tradePermit.ts`, `docs/GATE_TABLE.md` |
| 2 | Six canonical acceptance fixtures | ✅ | `test/tradePermit.test.ts` |
| 2 | Fail-closed branches, one test each | ✅ | `test/tradePermit.test.ts` |
| 3 | Permit signature (HMAC), expiry, single-use, market-state binding, chain, canonical serialization | ✅ | `wardenPermit.ts`, `wardenCard.ts`, `test/wardenPermit.test.ts` |
| 4 | Sim executor gateway (independent verify) | ✅ | `wardenExecutor.ts` |
| 4 | Atomic two-leg HEDGE bundle | ✅ | `wardenExecutor.ts`, `test/wardenExecutor.test.ts` |
| 4 | `demo_bypass` | ✅ | `scripts/demo-bypass.ts` (`pnpm demo:bypass`) |
| 5 | Ghost simulation (computed) | ✅ | `ghostSim.ts`, `test/ghostSim.test.ts` |
| 5 | Aggregate scorecard from real candles | ✅ | `scripts/run-scorecard.ts`, `fixtures/market/` |
| 6 | Close-only watcher (background, state cards) | ✅ | `closeOnlyWatcher.ts`, `scripts/demo-closeonly.ts` |
| 7 | WardenClaw MCP server (7 tools) | ✅ | `mcpServer.ts`, `scripts/warden-mcp-server.ts` |
| 7 | MCP end-to-end round-trip test | ✅ | `test/mcpServer.test.ts` |
| 8 | Structured logger (stdout + JSONL) | ✅ | `evidenceLog.ts` |
| 8 | `evidence:run` transcript | ✅ | `scripts/evidence-run.ts` |
| 8.b | Studio-parity paper records (NAV marks, round-trips, early win-rate/profit-factor) | 🟡 | partial — the internal paper engine (`paperEngine.ts`) records paper fills and the dashboard surfaces mandates; dedicated NAV/round-trip/win-rate views are **not yet** built out |
| 9 | UI (verdict badges, Playbook panel, comparison, verification panel, fail-closed banner, charts) | ❌ | **not yet** — the existing `/bitget` dashboard remains; the firewall-specific panels are pending (spec ranks enforcement + evidence above UI) |
| 10 | Full test suite | ✅ | 252 tests (174 core + 78 adapter) |
| 10 | Docs (README, GATE_TABLE, PLAYBOOK_SHIELD) | ✅ | `README.md`, `docs/GATE_TABLE.md`, `docs/PLAYBOOK_SHIELD.md` |
| 10 | Demo kit + submission blurb + this checklist | ✅ | `docs/DEMO_SCRIPT.md`, `docs/SUBMISSION_BLURB.md`, this file |

## Outstanding work (honest)

1. **Phase 9 UI** — surface the verdicts, the Playbook Shield panel, the original-vs-
   adjusted comparison, and the verification panel in `apps/web`. The data and the
   signed cards already exist; this is presentation.
2. **Phase 8.b studio-parity records** — NAV marks, round-trip records, and early
   win-rate / profit-factor views over the paper engine.

These are the only gaps; the enforcement spine, evidence, and scorecard are complete,
tested, and verified running on the deployment VPS.
